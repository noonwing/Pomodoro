# pomodoro_timer

A small project where I'm aiming to build a pomodoro timer for Linux/Windows to help me study.

Global features I want to implement:

- ❌ Working timer on a nice looking GUI
- ❌ Add an break timer
- ❌ Add the option to change both of the timers
- ❌ Play a custom sound when the timer reaches "00:00"
- ❌ Add the option to specify how many loops should the pomodoro do
- ❌ something else eventually . . .

Planing to use Python as a language for this one.
